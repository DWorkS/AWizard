`AWizard` library can be used for creating wizards very easily. It's based of Roman Nurik's wizard pager (https://code.google.com/p/romannurik-code/source/browse/misc/wizardpager)

You can use from out-of-box pages from the library or create your own pages easily. Review page and Done page can be placed any where.
